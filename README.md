- Greetings! I am on the interwebz known as @Hannaftw, but IRL people call me Hanna and I am (redacted) years old.
- I started coding in july of 2023 so I am very much a n00b. I find coding to be magical (and frustrating).
- I decided that it's not too late to change careers. I have a degree in Social Work and have been working in that field for many years.
- Apart from avoiding the sun and calming down from fits of rage when code isn't working I like to paint, hang with my cat and just generally being in nature (if it's not too much sun).
- I listen to far too many podcasts to keep up with them all, so little time so much to learn.
- It's not that I dislike people, I just like it when they're not around.

- So it goes.
