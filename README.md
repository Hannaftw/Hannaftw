- Greetings! I am usually known as @Hannaftw on the interwebz, I hail from Sweden and am (redacted) years old.
- I started coding in July of 2023, and I am very much still a a n00b. I find coding and programming to be beautiful and calming when the pieces of the puzzle come together, and any problem is overcome; otherwise, it is a source of frustration and rage (just like life in general, I suppose).
- I've got a Master's degree in Social Work and Bachelor's degrees in Law and Philosophy from Lund University (too many things are too interesting, and I may have been a little too ambitious during my University years). I have worked as a social worker for many years now, but staying in one field of work for your entire life is not really my thing, it seems. My fascination with technology and interest in programming, as part of a path to delve deeper into fields such as cyber security and ethical AI, has put me on the path to becoming a full-stack developer, one of the best decisions of my life.
- Apart from avoiding the sun and calming down from fits of rage when any technology isn't working, I like to paint, write stories and listen to an outrageous amount of audiobooks.
  
- It's not that I dislike people, I just like it better when they're not around. - Charles Bukowski
- So it goes. - Kurt Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse-Five).
- Must not sleep. Must warn others.
